## Makefile

The provided `Makefile` defines three commands:

| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `make build` | Removes the old test image (if it exists) and builds a new one. |
| `make run` | Starts the container interactively. |
| `make push` | Tags and pushes the image to Docker Hub (requires valid credentials and a `TAG` defined in `config.sh`). |

## Example usage

```bash
# Build the image
make build

# Run interactively
make run

# Push to Docker Hub (requires TAG)
make push
